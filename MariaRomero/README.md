#Gulpfile and package.json, April 6, 2016

##Description:
A gulpfile has been created for the 'greet' application, containing tasks to run mocha/chai tests,
as well as eslint on all files.  A watch task has also been setup that reruns tests/eslint when there
are changes to any file.

A package.json file has been created to include all dependencies and dev dependencies.
